This project leverages historical traffic data to forecast future traffic conditions. By analyzing vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks) and temporal data (time, date, day of the week), the model aims to predict traffic congestion and classify the traffic situation. The goal is to assist in better traffic management and provide insights for urban planning.
## Data Dictionary

The dataset contains traffic flow records, including:

Time: Timestamp of the observation
Date: Date of the observation
Day of the week: Day corresponding to the observation
CarCount: Number of cars counted at the observation point
BikeCount: Number of bikes counted
BusCount: Number of buses counted
TruckCount: Number of trucks counted
Total: Total number of vehicles at the timestamp
Traffic Situation: The categorized traffic condition (e.g., congestion levels)
## Objectives:
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand traffic patterns.
- Train machine learning models to predict traffic flow and classify traffic situations (e.g., "normal", "high").
- Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes traffic counts from multiple types of vehicles recorded at different times of the day and days of the week. The features include:
- Vehicle counts (Cars, Bikes, Buses, Trucks)
- Date and time
- Traffic situations
- 
## Model:
The prediction model uses historical data to forecast traffic flow. It helps stakeholders and decision-makers manage traffic systems more effectively.
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
A Random Forest Classifier was implemented to forecast traffic conditions by utilizing the dataset's features. The model excelled at identifying high-traffic times, providing key insights that could assist in traffic management and planning.

Evaluation Metrics:

Confusion Matrix: Used to examine both misclassifications and correctly predicted traffic situations.
Classification Report: Offered detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each traffic condition category.
Accuracy: The model demonstrated reliable accuracy in categorizing various traffic situations.
Key Features:
The following features had the greatest influence on the modelâ€™s predictions:

CarCount
BikeCount
Day of the Week
Time of Day
These factors were critical in forecasting traffic situations effectively.
Visual Insights:
Multiple graphs were generated to deepen the analysis:

Traffic Trends Over Time: Cars and bikes showed a significant increase during rush hours, while truck volumes remained relatively consistent.


## Conclusion
This Traffic Flow Prediction project demonstrates the importance of analyzing vehicle counts, time, and day of the week to gain a clearer understanding of traffic dynamics. By identifying peak congestion periods, it offers valuable insights that can assist city planners and traffic managers in making informed decisions. These predictions enable better control of traffic signals, more efficient public transportation scheduling, and improved road utilization during non-peak hours.

The project plays a vital role in supporting the development of smart cities, where real-time data can be used to dynamically manage traffic, reduce disruptions, and mitigate the environmental impacts caused by congestion.

Furthermore, the project highlights the broader benefits of sustainable urban mobility. By improving traffic management and reducing vehicle emissions, accurate traffic flow predictions can contribute to more efficient road systems. This leads to not only a reduction in time wasted in traffic but also enhances economic productivity and the overall efficiency of urban transportation networks.
