# Traffic Flow Prediction

This project leverages historical traffic data to forecast future traffic conditions. By analyzing vehicle counts (cars, bikes, buses, trucks) and temporal data (time, date, day of the week), the model aims to predict traffic congestion and classify the traffic situation. The goal is to assist in better traffic management and provide insights for urban planning.

## Objectives:
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand traffic patterns.
- Train machine learning models to predict traffic flow and classify traffic situations (e.g., "normal", "high").
- Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters to improve accuracy.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes traffic counts from multiple types of vehicles recorded at different times of the day and days of the week. The features include:
- Vehicle counts (Cars, Bikes, Buses, Trucks)
- Date and time
- Traffic situations

## Model:
The prediction model uses historical data to forecast traffic flow. It helps stakeholders and decision-makers manage traffic systems more effectively.
